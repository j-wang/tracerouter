# Tracerouter
Yet another traceroute implementation in Python.

## Motivation
Written primarily for educational purposes (for myself). Feel free to use/rip off as needed though.

## Todos

- Debug strange timeout issues that occur for some sites
- Implement asynchronous traces with non-blocking sockets
- Send multiple packets per ttl (right now only sends one vs. standard traceroute 3)
